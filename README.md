# Study Group Lessons

Let's build a collection of introductory lessons for short tutorials on scientific coding and data management people can deliver to a study group in their labs and departments.

### What's a Study Group and How do I Start One?

Study groups are a great casual way to get people from your field together to share their skills in computing and data management, in a relaxed, no-pressure environment with friends and colleagues. The goal should be to help everyone get some hands-on practice with a new idea or tool they can use in their every-day research. A simple formula:

 - Meet once or twice a month
 - Meetings should be at *most* one hour long
 - Grab a room in your department and welcome everyone to join in (no experience necessary!)
 
### What is a Study Group Lesson Like?

A good study group lesson should be a tutorial that's *as hands on as possible* - an hour-long lecture just doesn't have the same effect. To create a successful tutorial, keep the following in mind:

 - Give participants challenge questions to try out their new skills as often as possible; never lecture for more than five minutes at a stretch.
 - Go as slow as the participants need; never rush to get through all the material.
 - Encourage people to work together and chat about what they're learning and how they might use it.
 - Try to come up with examples that are relevant and interesting from your field of study.

Have a look in the template directory of this repository for some more details.

### Contribution Guidelines

Contributing a study group lesson here is simple - just copy the `template` directory, give it a descriptive name, and fill out the `lesson.md` file with your lesson. Be sure to include lots of problems for students to work on, and put any examples or data they'll need in the same directory.

**Not comfortable with Markdown or Git?** That's ok! If Markdown isn't your thing, just cut and paste your notes into a plain text file, and we'll help you format them; if you're unsure of git, open a new [issue](https://github.com/mozillascience/studyGroupLessons/issues) and we'll help get you included.
